# SalesTaxEstimator
A sales tax estimator browser extension.

This extension is intended for U.S. audiences where sales tax is not automatically added to the advertised sale price of an item.
Many other countries do this by default to make calculating a purchase simpler.

This extension is free to use, does not collect any personal information, and is open-source.
Simply configure the settings by entering your zip code, and the sales tax estimate will be added to each item on a given site.

# Please note that these are ESTIMATES and the actual value may be different.
